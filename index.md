This is a series of talks given by graduate students (MSc and PhD) that runs weekly every term. The topics for this seminar are typically related to the speakers' research interests, they might include the current student research, previous projects or any interesting mathematical notion that is not taught in the standard courses. The speaker must present interesting/important facts from any area of mathematics in a way that can be understood by students from different backgrounds.

The seminar is intended to increase awareness about the research activity of graduate students in the department, to provide an opportunity for graduate students to enhance their presentation skills and to connect and interact with fellow students from different research areas.

The seminar is organized by graduate students, and is intended for a graduate student audience. If you have any questions or you are interested in giving a talk please contact one of the organizers.
