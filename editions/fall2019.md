<h2 style="color:darkviolet"> Sergio Chaves. Equivariant Cohomology of $\mathbb{Z}/2$-manifolds <br/> (Friday Sep 27, 2019) </h2>
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
If $N$ is a compact manifold with boundary, then it can be realized as the orbit space of a $\mathbb{Z}/2$-manifold $M$; more precisely, as the quotient $M/\tau$ where $M$ is a manifold of the same dimension as $N$ and $\tau \colon M \rightarrow M$ is an involution. The manifold $M$ might not be unique and it depends on the principal $\mathbb{Z}/2$-bundles over $N$. However, the equivariant cohomology module-type of these manifolds is completely determined by the cohomology of $N$. Before discussing these results, the necessary background on principal bundles and equivariant cohomology will be firstly introduced; only basic notions about singular cohomology will be assumed.
